# 🛡️ Face Recognition Surveillance with SMS Alerts

A Python-based home surveillance system that uses **face recognition** to detect known and unknown individuals in real-time via webcam. When an unknown person is detected, it **starts video recording** and sends an **SMS alert** to the specified phone number using **Twilio**.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Detects faces using `face_recognition` and classifies as **known** or **unknown**.
- 🧠 Loads known faces from a directory and matches with live video feed.
- 🎥 Automatically **records video** when an unknown face is detected.
- 📱 Sends **SMS alerts** via Twilio when unknown faces appear.
- ✅ Stops recording automatically after a few seconds of no unknown activity.
- 📂 Saves recorded videos in a designated directory.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. 📦 Install Required Libraries:
    pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy twilio

> Note: `face_recognition` requires `dlib` which might need CMake and Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows.

2. 📁 Add Known Faces:
```text
    known_faces/
    ├── John/
    │   ├── john1.jpg
    │   └── john2.jpg
    └── Alice/
        └── alice.jpg
```
4. 🔐 Configure Twilio:
Replace the placeholders in the script:

    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID"
   
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
   
    TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = "+1234567890"
   
    RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER = "+91XXXXXXXXXX"

6. ▶️ Run the Program:
    python surveillance.py
